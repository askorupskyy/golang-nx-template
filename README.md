# Golang Nx Template

This setup is a well-designed template for my (and possibly your) projects.

# Requirements

- Node>=20.9.0
- Golang>=1.20.1

You are always welcome to use Docker to manage spin everything up in this repo.

# Running things...

Installing deps:
- `npm i`
- `go mod download`

Starting servers:
- API: `npx nx serve api`
- WEB: `npx nx serve www`


# Things I am currently working on:
- React-query library.
- SQL codegen with `sqlc`
- Sample APIs with `echo.go`
- Some UI utils and hooks I use daily as well.
